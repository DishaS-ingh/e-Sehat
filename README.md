# **E-Sehat - Bridging the Gap to Better Health, Everywhere.**

## Problem Statement:

In rural areas, there is a significant lack of awareness about basic health practices, preventive healthcare, and the importance of regular health checkups. This gap in health literacy leads to delayed diagnoses, poor management of chronic conditions, and increased vulnerability to preventable diseases. Furthermore, limited access to healthcare facilities and financial constraints prevent rural populations from seeking timely medical care, resulting in suboptimal health outcomes. Addressing this issue requires focused educational campaigns, increased healthcare accessibility, and affordable healthcare services to encourage regular health checkups and empower rural communities to take proactive steps toward maintaining their health.

## Proposed Idea:

We establish E-Health Centres in rural areas across approximately 600,000 villages in India, equipped with adequate infrastructure to provide quality healthcare services.

We collaborate with private and government hospitals to ensure access to medical expertise, and we aim to partner with international hospitals to make experienced doctors available 24/7.

Emergency services are supported by on-site ambulances, ready to be deployed whenever required.

Each centre has trained caretakers, preferably recruited from the local village or town, who are equipped with basic healthcare knowledge. This approach not only ensures better community engagement but also generates employment opportunities in rural areas.

We actively promote E-Health Centres through targeted awareness campaigns to educate communities about common diseases, infections, and preventive healthcare measures, fostering a culture of informed health practices.
